Given the below data structure (time series of 600 points in 1 minute intervals), write code in javascript  to do the following:

Conflate data to 1 hour intervals, calculating Open, Close, High, Low, and (total) Volume.

Calculate % change for each new interval (from Open to Close)
Create a visualization (using any DOM methods  you want (e.g. plain HTML, SVG or Canvas) that shows each hourly interval:
Ordered by percent change, from positive to negative
Color coded green for positive and red for negative.  If you would like - you can use gradations to indicate relative intensity of change.

Visualization can be anything you like, bar chart or heatmap for example.
